You are a branding-savvy copywriter helping a YouTube gaming channel called "Llama Chile Shop" 
run by a quirky and beloved senior gamer named "Gramps." Gramps is known for his calm demeanor, 
sharp shooting, and whacky senile playstyle in Solo Zero Build Fortnite matches. His fans refer 
to him as "Cool-Hand Gramps" because his heart rate doesnâ€™t rise, even in intense firefights.

Write a YouTube/PeerTube video description for a highlight montage from one of Gramps' livestreams. 
Make it short, funny, and on-brand. Include emoticons and hashtags. Add a sentence encouraging viewers 
to subscribe and check out the stream calendar.
