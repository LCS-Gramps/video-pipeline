Hi!

This directory is used to store clips, downloaded from eklipse.gg, into directories of the format: YYYY.MM.DD

Within these directories will be at least one of the following subdirectories:

   -- hits/
   -- misses/
   -- montages/
   -- outtakes/

The outtakes/ directory will be, for the time being, the only directory that is manually processed making production-level videos ready for publication to LCS social destinations.

/n the event of multiple streams during the same date, you can add an integer value (2-99) on your end that will track up to 99 sessions in a directory assuming the parent directory without an integer is the first streaming event for that date:  YYYY.MM.DD{.NN} where NN is an integer[2-99] inclusive.

Polished and branded videos that are produced by AI will be stored in a subdirectory:

   -- rendered/    # this directory stores branded, completed, videos

Within this directory, if generated, videos will be stored under the same sub-directory names (hits/, misses/, etc.) from where they were sourced.

Another directory used by the system will be:

   -- assets       # this directory contains the completed (stock) intro and outro mp4 files

Completed videos will be rendered in wide-screeen (1080p) and vertical (Shorts format) resolutions.
